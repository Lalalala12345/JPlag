This qualitative survey explores the purpose of sharing vacation-
related experiences on social media. While people have long
shared their travel stories with others, the rise of social media has
made it easier to showcase and document our holiday adventures
with family and friends. To better understand this phenomenon, the
survey draws upon participantsâ€™ personal experiences and self-
reported motivations for sharing vacation-related content on social
media. The survey will analyze the types of content shared, the
motivations for sharing, and the effects of sharing on their holiday
experience. The results of this survey will provide insight into the
motivations behind sharing our vacation experiences on social
media, and the impact it has on our travel experiences.
